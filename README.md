I learned how to use gradle, mustache, heroku and circleci in this project. I also learned how to open a web page, receive and use inputs. I'm more familiar with github. As for the project, I took two numbers and an array. I calculated the standard deviation of the numbers in the array and returned true if between two given numbers, otherwise false.
